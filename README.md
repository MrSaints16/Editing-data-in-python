# Editing-data-in-python
Simple steps useful to edit data in python
## Getting started 
Following these instructions will let you edit, change, replace, and do more to your data in python. It's easy and useful in data analytics
## Prerequisites 
TO run this code, you need an IDE such as pycham and a dataset in .cvs format
## Installing 
To install pycharm go to [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), download and install it on your system 
After installing, you're all set
## Running the Tests 
Many different types of data manipulation is covered in the code. Lets break them down
### Dividing columns in dataset 
This feature lets user divide two different column in a dataset and outputs the result in a different column. The example uses benchmark value and salaries, divides them and returns the value in the column designated. 
### Dropping columns in dataset
It is sometimes useful to drop columns in a dataset which might not be useful in analysis. The code shows two different examples wherein the first method selects the columns to be included and the second method drops the columns selected.
### Joining dataframes 
This is essential when it comes to joining two different datasets into one. It's a simple line of code but handy when dealing with lots of datasets.
### Changing Column names
Sometimes column names can be wrong and needs to be changed to better explain the data it holds. It can be done in few simple steps using my preferred method of .rename(). It is quick and easy as compared to other example shown in the code. 
### Reordering Columns 
Again, this is an easy process which requires assigning a new variable with new order of columns and then merging it with the dataframe.
### Using Groupby, when and where in dataframe
These functions are used to sort, find and highlight data in a dataset. Groupby() function is used to sort data using catagorical inputs in a column as shown in the code. When function is used to further sort data based on conditions set by the user, as in the code, data is sorted and given a rank based on the amount of salary. Where function is used to sort data based on single identifier such as male in the code example.
